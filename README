type 'make'  to compile

 type ./myshell to run with stdin

 for fileinput testcase type ./myshell <inputfilename>
after run all the command from file ,shell will be remain opened. so you can try stdin to run other command.

P.S: in I/O redirection after the arrow symbol (e.g: >> , > ,<) just put one space then type the fileName
