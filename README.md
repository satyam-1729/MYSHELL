# Custom Linux Shell

1. `make`  to compile
2. `./myshell` to run with stdin
3. For fileinput testcase type `./myshell <inputfilename>`
after run all the command from file ,shell will be remain opened. so you can try stdin to run other command.

### P.S: In I/O redirection after the arrow symbol (e.g: >> , > ,<) just put one space then type the fileName
